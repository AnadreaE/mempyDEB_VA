# Python setup for DynModTox course



In short, you will need the following components installed:

- [Anaconda (includes Python)](https://docs.anaconda.com/distro-or-miniconda/)
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
    - If you are familiar with Python and prefer to use another environment which can all the listed components, that's ok too.
- Jupyter extensions
    - Installable within VSCode through the extensions menu (square symbol on the left)
- Packages provided through the virtual environment

It is recommended to get acquainted with the use of conda environments, specifically [their use within VSCode](https://docs.anaconda.com/working-with-conda/ide-tutorials/vscode/), i.e. how to create an environment, activate it and install packages within it. Anaconda is used to create virtual environments, so that packages are not installed globally, but project-specifically. This is not strictly necessary, but can avoid a lot of problems if Python is used for different projects simultaneously (you can have different versions of packages installed simultaenously, and have them neatly listed within an environment file). <br>
