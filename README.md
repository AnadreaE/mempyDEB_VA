mempyDEB is a Python package that provides the basics for doing DEB-TKTD modelling in Python. 
It mostly defines a baseline model, default parameters and functions to run the model.

## Installation

`pip install git+https://github.com/simonhansul/mempyDEB.git`

(e.g. in Anaconda prompt with the desired environment activated).

## Getting started

The examples directory contains a notebook which demonstrates the basic functionality of this package. <br>
Generally, `mempyDEB` is a fairly slim package, designed as a low-barrier entry point to DEB-TKTD modelling. <br>
There are not many functions, but the code can be adapted to be used for more extensive (research) tasks.
